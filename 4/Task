Write a program to calculate the total cost of different types of furniture. You will be given some lines of input until you receive the line "Purchase". For the line to be valid it should be in the following format:
">>{furniture name}<<{price}!{quantity}"
The price can be floating-point number or whole number. Print the names of the furniture and the total price. At the end print each bought furniture item on a separate line in the format:

Example:
Input:
>>Sofa<<312.23!3
>>TV<<300!5
>Invalid<<!5
Purchase

Output:
Bought furniture:
Sofa
TV
Total money spent: 2436.69
